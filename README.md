# YubiKey GPG (with SSH) Guide

This is a guide on how to setup YubiKey for GPG and SSH. It's based on [drduh/YubiKey-Guide](https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide) with some tiny changes:

* It's much less descriptive - just a series of steps/commands to execute. It assumes you've done it before and/or understand what you are doing. Use it if you want to follow a recipe for a quick execution. If it's your first time, read the [original guide](https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide) to understand the process.
* It configures YubiKey to require touch on every GPG action (additionally, not instead of PIN) using [a-dma/yubitouch](https://github.com/a-dma/yubitouch) script
* It includes instructions to split backup copy of the keys with Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme, using [themand/shamir-sharing](https://github.com/themand/shamir-sharing)

## Requirements

* The guide assumes you run [Tails Linux](https://tails.boum.org/). It will work on other systems (if all software requirements from the original guide are installed), but I use and recommend using Tails for this task.
* You need to have a working networking to download software. It's recommended to disable networking after downloading software and before generating any keys. If using USB WiFi dongle, you can simply unplug it to make sure you're offline.  

## Verify YubiKey

Use Yubico's [Verify YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/genuine/) to confirm that you have a genuine YubiKey.

## Create keys and setup YubiKey

### Download required software and config files

Download [themand/shamir-sharing](https://github.com/themand/shamir-sharing) binaries

```bash
export BINDIR=$(mktemp -d)
mkdir -p "$BINDIR"
curl -Lo "$BINDIR"/shamir-split https://github.com/themand/shamir-sharing/releases/download/v1.0.3/linux-shamir-split
curl -Lo "$BINDIR"/shamir-restore https://github.com/themand/shamir-sharing/releases/download/v1.0.3/linux-shamir-restore
shasum -a 256 "$BINDIR"/shamir-split | grep c9df5aac18520dfd9444447c5f68eeb3b9b4e8969b9474e9ebe68be78728ff4a && chmod +x "$BINDIR"/shamir-split && echo OK || echo "===== shamir-split checksum DOES NOT MATCH. ABORT! ====="
shasum -a 256 "$BINDIR"/shamir-restore | grep 7c7fd65fd50dc9770770dc6b0c167fd7252fdbcf1134e5da2b3836b53a7f55bf && chmod +x "$BINDIR"/shamir-restore && echo OK || echo "===== shamir-restore checksum DOES NOT MATCH. ABORT! ====="
```

Download [themand/yubitouch](https://github.com/themand/yubitouch)

```bash
curl -Lo "$BINDIR"/yubitouch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/themand/yubitouch/master/yubitouch.sh
shasum -a 256 "$BINDIR"/yubitouch | grep 20d0b3aee42948cd3d7aaf9ef9ebdedbb91edbc4a38bc4a65d8e10d064194adc && chmod +x "$BINDIR"/yubitouch || echo "===== yubitouch checksum DOES NOT MATCH. ABORT! ====="
```

Download [themand/macos-bootstrap/dotfiles/gpg.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/themand/macos-bootstrap/master/bootstrap/assets/dotfiles/.gnupg/gpg.conf) with reasonable and secure GPG defaults.

```bash
export GPGCONF=$(mktemp)
curl -Lo "$GPGCONF" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/themand/macos-bootstrap/master/bootstrap/assets/dotfiles/.gnupg/gpg.conf
```

### Go offline

Terminate networking, it will no longer be needed.

### Prepare temporary directories

```bash
export GNUPGHOME=$(mktemp -d)
mv "$GPGCONF" "$GNUPGHOME"/gpg.conf
unset GPGCONF
export EXPORTDIR=$(mktemp -d)
mkdir "$EXPORTDIR"/secret
```

### Create a master key

Optional: if you don't have your own, strong passhprase (preferably generated using diceware), you can generate a random password:

```bash
gpg --gen-random -a 2 24
```

Generate a new key, using the following choices for interactive options:

```
gpg --expert --full-generate-key
- 8         RSA (set your own capabilities)
- E         Disable encryption
- S         Disable signing
- Q         Finish if allowed action is only: Certify
- 4096
- 0         Don't expire master key
- Y         Really don't expire
- ...name
- ...email
- ...comment (can be left blank)
- O         Okay
```

Export the key ID as a variable for further use (copy and paste it from generated output):

```bash
export KEYID=0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Create subkeys

Create subkeys for signing, encryption and auth. Change expiration time if you wish (e.g. to 1y), the following example uses no expiration.

```
gpg --expert --edit-key "$KEYID"

addkey
- 4         RSA (sign only)
- 4096
- 0         Never expire (change it to 1y or whatever you need)
- Y         This is correct
- Y         Really create

addkey
- 6         RSA (encrypt only)
- 4096
- 0         Never expire (change it to 1y or whatever you need)
- Y         This is correct
- Y         Really create

addkey
- 8         RSA (set your own capabilities)
- S         Disable sign
- E         Disable encrypt
- A         Enable authenticate
- Q         Finish if allowed action is only: Authenticate
- 4096
- 0         Never expire (change it to 1y or whatever you need)
- Y         This is correct
- Y         Really create

save
``` 

### Verify keys

```bash
gpg --list-secret-keys
```

You should see a master key (sec) and three subkeys (ssb).

### Export keys

#### Export private keys

```bash
export KEYNAME=$(gpg --list-keys "$KEYID" | grep uid | sed 's/.*<\(.*\)>.*/\1/g')
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys "$KEYID" > "$EXPORTDIR"/secret/"$KEYNAME".master.gpg.key
gpg --armor --export-secret-subkeys "$KEYID" > "$EXPORTDIR"/secret/"$KEYNAME".sub.gpg.key
```

#### Export public keys

```bash
gpg --armor --export "$KEYID" > "$EXPORTDIR"/"$KEYNAME".gpg.pubkey.txt
gpg --armor --export-ssh-key "$KEYID" > "$EXPORTDIR"/"$KEYNAME".gpg.pubkey.ssh.txt
```

#### Archive GPG homedir

It includes master key revocation certificate which you will need in the future.

```bash
cd "$GNUPGHOME"
tar cf "$EXPORTDIR"/secret/"$KEYNAME".gpg-homedir.tar *
gzip "$EXPORTDIR"/secret/"$KEYNAME".gpg-homedir.tar
```

#### Split exported secrets using shamir-split

Change desired threshold and number of shares.

```bash
export SHAMIR_THRESHOLD=2
export SHAMIR_SHARES=3
cd "$EXPORTDIR"/secret
shamir-split "$SHAMIR_THRESHOLD" "$SHAMIR_SHARES" "$KEYNAME".gpg-homedir.tar.gz
shamir-split "$SHAMIR_THRESHOLD" "$SHAMIR_SHARES" "$KEYNAME".master.gpg.key
shamir-split "$SHAMIR_THRESHOLD" "$SHAMIR_SHARES" "$KEYNAME".sub.gpg.key
unset SHAMIR_THRESHOLD
unset SHAMIR_SHARES
```

### Backup exported keys into a secure location

Preferably move shares into individual locations

```bash
mv *-1 /.....
mv *-2 /.....
```

It's also a good idea to store [shamir-sharing binaries](https://github.com/themand/shamir-sharing/releases) with actual shares (e.g. on the same USB drives), even for all platforms, to ensure you will always be able to combine secrets.

### Configure YubiKey GPG Smartcard

#### Require touch for GPG operations

```bash
"$BINDIR"/yubitouch sig on
"$BINDIR"/yubitouch aut on
"$BINDIR"/yubitouch dec on
``` 

#### Change PIN and Admin PIN

```
gpg --card-edit

admin
- 3         change Admin PIN
- 1         change PIN
- q         quit

quit
```

### Transfer keys to YubiKey

**Warning:** Transferring keys to YubiKey is a destructive, one-way operation only. Make sure you've made a backup before proceeding.

```
gpg --edit-key "$KEYID"

key 1

keytocard
- 1         Signature key

key 1

key 2

keytocard
- 2         Encryption key

key 2

key 3

keytocard
- 3         Authentication key

save
```

### Verify card keys

```bash
gpg --list-secret-keys
```

You should see a master key (sec) and three subkeys (ssb). The subkeys should exist only on keycard, which is indicated by *>* after ssb: *ssb>*

### Cleanup

Ensure that you have:

* Saved the Encryption, Signing and Authentication subkeys to YubiKey.
* Saved the YubiKey PINs which you changed from defaults.
* Saved the password to the Master key.
* Saved a copy of the Master key, subkeys and revocation certificates (GPG homedir)
* Saved a copy of the public key somewhere easily accessible later.

Reboot or securely delete directories containing secrets:

```bash
srm -r "$GNUPGHOME"
srm -r "$EXPORTDIR"
unset GNUPGHOME
unset EXPORTDIR
```

Delete downloaded binaries if you no longer need shamir-sharing

```bash
rm -r "$BINDIR"
unset BINDIR
```
